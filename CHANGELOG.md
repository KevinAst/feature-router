## v3.0.0 - Configuration at Construction Time *(January, xx, 2020)*

[GitHub Content](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/tree/v3.0.0)
&bull;
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
&bull;
[Diff](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/compare/v1.0.1...v3.0.0)


**NOTE**: ?? This release is a **non-breaking change** _(i.e. no API was affected)_.

**NOTE**: ?? This release contains **breaking changes** from prior
releases.  _A retrofit of client code is necessary_.
?? This release does in fact introduce breaking changes (due to configuration now occurring at construction time).

- Pardon the version bump (from v1.0.1 to v3.0.0).  We skipped v2
  strictly as an internal management convenience - to match the
  current **feature-u** version _(which is also v3.0.0)_.

- **More**: ??

- **Security**: ?? Address potential security vulnerabilities in
  dependent libs (mostly devDependencies completely unrelated to
  deployment)!


<!-- *** RELEASE *************************************************************** -->

## v1.0.1 - Address Security Alerts *(December 10, 2019)*

[GitHub Content](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/tree/v1.0.1)
&bull;
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/releases/tag/v1.0.1)
&bull;
[Diff](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1)

**NOTE**: This release is a **non-breaking change** _(i.e. no API was affected)_.

- **Security**: Address potential security vulnerabilities in
  dependent libs (mostly devDependencies completely unrelated to
  deployment)!

- **Changed**: The `componentWillUpdateHook$` configuration was
  renamed to `componentDidUpdateHook$`, and interfaces to the hook
  by the same name.  NOTE: This is in support of ReactNative animation.
  `componentWillUpdate` has been deprecated, however relative to 
  ReactNative animation, `componentDidUpdate` evidently works as expected
  ... see: [React Nativeâ€™s LayoutAnimation in the post-componentWillUpdate age](https://medium.com/@benadamstyles/react-native-layoutanimation-in-the-post-componentwillupdate-age-9146b3af0243).


<!-- *** RELEASE *************************************************************** -->

## v1.0.0 - feature-u V1 Integration *(August 14, 2018)*

[GitHub Content](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/tree/v1.0.0)
&bull;
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
&bull;
[Diff](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/compare/v0.1.3...v1.0.0)

**NOTE**: This release contains **breaking changes** from prior
releases _(i.e. a retrofit of client code is necessary)_.

- **Added/Removed**: Eliminate singletons in favor of creators

  The singleton: `routeAspect`, has been replaced with a new creator:
  `createRouteAspect()`.

  This is useful in both testing and server side rendering.

- **Review**: Integrate to [**feature-u V1**](https://feature-u.js.org/cur/history.html#v1_0_0)

  **feature-u V1** has replaced the `app` object with a `fassets`
  object.

  In general, this is not a change that would normally break a plugin,
  because app/fassets is a positional parameter that is merely passed
  through the plugin.

  However, because **feature-router** auto injects the [`Fassets
  object`] as a named parameter of the [`routeCB()`] API, the routes
  in your application code must reflect this change by renaming this
  named parameter from `app` to `fassets`, and utilize the new fassets
  API accordingly.

  As a result, this plugin has now updated it's **feature-u**
  peerDependency to ">=1.0.0".


<!-- *** RELEASE *************************************************************** -->

## v0.1.3 - Establish Polyfill Strategy *(July 2, 2018)*

[GitHub Content](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/tree/v0.1.3)
&bull;
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/releases/tag/v0.1.3)
&bull;
[Diff](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/compare/v0.1.1...v0.1.3)

**NOTE**: This release is a **non-breaking change** _(i.e. no API was affected)_.

- **Review**: A new policy is in affect where **polyfills are the
  responsibility of the client app**, when the target JavaScript
  engine is inadequate _(such as the IE browser)_.  Please refer to
  [Potential Need for
  Polyfills](./README.md#potential-need-for-polyfills) for more
  information.

  As a result, all previous code patches related to es2015+ polyfill
  issues were removed, in favor of **polyfilling at the app-level**.

- **Internal**: The most current babel version/configuration is now
  used to transpile the library's es5 distribution.




<!-- *** RELEASE *************************************************************** -->

## v0.1.1 - react-native android patch *(March 7, 2018)*

[GitHub Content](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/tree/v0.1.1)
&bull;
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/releases/tag/v0.1.1)
&bull;
[Diff](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-router/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1)

**NOTE**: This release is a **non-breaking change** _(i.e. no API was affected)_.

- A patch was applied in support of **react-native android**.

  When running react-native under android, receiving the following
  exception:

  ```
  ERROR: undefined is not a function
         evaluating 'content[typeof Symbol === 'function' ? Symbol.iterator: '@@iterator']()'
  ```

  This is a transpiler issue related to the es6 "for of" loop.  It is
  believed to be limited to the **react-native android JS engine**.

  This may be a babel transpiler issue (possibly due to a stale babel
  version), or an issue with with react-native android's JS engine.
  The problem was temporarily avoided by employing old style es5 "for
  loop" constructs (till further research is conducted).
